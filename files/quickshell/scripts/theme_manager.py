"""Wallpaper and palette backend for the Quickshell shell.

Sets the wallpaper, extracts a palette from it, and writes that palette into
the other themed programs: kitty, btop, cava, yazi, neovim, imv, GTK, Qt and
KDE, the Papirus folder icons, Vesktop, Spotify, VSCodium and Zen. Generated
files live in the XDG state directory unless a program only reads its theme
