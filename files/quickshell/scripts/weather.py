"""One wttr.in reading, reduced to what the weather card shows.

With no place configured, wttr.in locates the request by IP, which needs no
key but is only approximate. A named place (a city, a postcode, an airport
code, a `~landmark`) is sent as is. The place that answered is always
reported back.

Any failure is reported as unavailable, never as a guessed value.
